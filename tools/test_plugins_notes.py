"""F2 regression: only real plugins may be reported as "not enabled".

The notes loop in ``check_plugins`` tested nothing but ``os.path.isdir``, while
``_collect_plugin_ids`` requires a ``plugin.yaml``/``plugin.yml`` manifest. Any
stray directory under ``$HERMES_HOME/plugins`` was therefore announced as an
opt-in plugin — on the reference install that meant a state-file directory and
a vendored Node checkout were reported on every run.

Guards:

1. A manifest-less directory produces no note (core does not treat it as a
   plugin either).
2. A directory with a manifest, not listed in enabled/disabled, still produces
   a note (the real feature keeps working).
3. The note is keyed on the manifest ``name``, not the directory basename, so a
   plugin whose manifest name differs from its directory is reported once and
   under the identifier ``plugins.enabled`` actually matches.
4. An enabled plugin whose manifest name differs from its directory is not
   reported as missing.

Uses a synthetic ``$HERMES_HOME`` and never invokes the ``hermes`` CLI.
